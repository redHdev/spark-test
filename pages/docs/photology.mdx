The fundamental concept of light, inseparable from energy, holds a pivotal position in our comprehension of the universe. This paper introduces "Photology," a new interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding the relationships between light and different forms of energy, and "Photocentricism," which posits light as the non-physical centre of the universe. The "Energy Continuum" model and the concept of "Energy Convergence" lie at the heart of Photology, wherein light takes on the role of the prime connector. Through a critical review of non-fictional literary works and academic discussions, we aim to untangle the intricate web of connections between light and other energy forms under the umbrella of Photology.
